        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          We are a family who just plain love golden doodles. We have made it our goal to help raise beautiful golden doodle puppies and to help them
          find the perfect home.

          <h3>Family Owned</h3>
          <p class="babydoodle-reason-description">
            Our puppies are raised in a family environment. We completely support adoption and urge all potential owners to consider adopting their
            family members first. We are also aware that for some it is not a feasable solution to adopt, so we are doing our best to offer family
            raised golden doodles. From their birth they are including in our family activities.

          <h3>Special Attention</h3>
          <p class="chilli-skill-description">
            We do not have more than one litter at a time. Each puppy receives all the care, love, and attention that our family of 6 can provide. As
            soon as they are active and ready for play, they are socialized with the other doodles in our family as well as socialized with children
            ranging in ages of 1 to 12 years old.
